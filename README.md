# SARMA
This is a repository about application code of SARMA paper. 
We have placed all the relevant program codes we need in the main folder.


The "help function for LS.py" provides the basic functions for "BCD_LS.py",
enabling the implementation of the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for the loss function related to least squares estimation (LSE).
Similarly, the "help function for MLE.py" complements "BCD_MLE.py", forming the basis for the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation (QMLE) method.
"IOLS_VARMA" is a iterative LS method for solving VARMA model.
